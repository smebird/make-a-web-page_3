                <strong>The internet:</strong> Sends an HTTP request to a server

              <li>
               <strong>Server:</strong> Locates HTML document and sends it to your computer where your web browser interprets and displays it on your screen

						<b>HTML</b> (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is the heart of the web.

					<p class="TextFormat Text1">
						HTML is made up of:

						Basic HTML vocabulary you should know:
				</h2>
					<h3 class="Subtitle1">
						Element:
					</h3>
					<p class="TextFormat Text1">
						A structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
					</p>
					<p class="TextFormat Text1">
            Elements can be either <em><strong>inline</strong></em> (effecting just the text enclosed by tags), or <em><strong>block</strong></em> (block elements have an invisible box around them with height and width that separates them from any other element). While most Elements have both an <em><strong>opening</strong></em> and <em><strong>closing</strong></em> tag, some Elements use only one tag and are referred to as <em><strong>void.</strong></em>
          </p>
					<h3 class="Subtitle1">
						Tags:
					</h3>
					<p class="TextFormat Text1">
						Tags mark the beginning and end of an Element.  They are made of a less-than symbol, followed by the Element's name, followed by a greater-than symbol.
					</p>
					<h3 class="Subtitle1">
						Attributes and values:
					</h3>
					<p class="TextFormat Text1">
						Attributes follow tags and point to a value. Examples are images and links to other web pages
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="AtRight">
					<h2 class="TextFormat Title1">
						A Couple Other Points to Remember:
					</h2>
						<h3 class="Subtitle1">
							Computers are stupid
						</h3>
						<p class="TextFormat Text1">
							Why?  Because they interpret instruction literally.  If you use the wrong Element name in your opening tag or make a typo, a computer cannot "know" what you intended. A program will only work if the instructions are clear and the grammar correct.
						</p>
						<h3 class="Subtitle1">
							There Is Far Too Much to Remember
						</h3>
						<p class="TextFormat Text1">
							Don't try to memorize every single fact.  Instead, concentrate on  understanding how programming languages work, and rely on the internet to remind you of an Element's name or a particular structure.

            <li>
              Choose "Developer Tools." A panel will open showing the structure of the web page you are on.  This is not the code, but how the browser interprets it.

            <li>
            	Click on the triangles to reveal hidden level

            </li>
          </ol>
        </div> 
        <div class="TextFormat Text2">
          <p>
            For two good articles about Tree-like Structure, check out the following Wikipedia pages:

          <p></p>
          <p>
            Once you know the language, you can look at any HTML code and understand a great deal about how it will look as a web page.  Likewise, you can view any web page and know what the underlying code looks like.

            <li>
             We organize code by determining the placement and size of the largest "boxes" first, and defining smaller and smaller boxes into those spaces.

            <li>
            	Every "box" is defined by the tag "div."

            </ul>
          <p>
           	In this example, the word "class" is an attribute. It allows the user to add CSS style choices to every h1 element with the value "article."

          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              <strong>Cascading </strong>refers to the process of moving from the most general property to the most specific property in your document.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>styles</strong> used in your project can be broken into separate CSS files or <strong>"sheets"</strong> to aid in organizing.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS properties, or rules, work in a hierarchy, much as laws function in a country:

      	Calculating Box Size

          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              To make the calculation easier, we put the following code into our CSS file:
            </p>
              <ol class="IndentedText">
               <li>* { </li>
                <li>box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                <li> } </li>
              </ol>
            <p>
              Now, the calculation of the box includes both the border and the padding, so that it's easier to make layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              You just set the width of the overall box, and no matter how you tweak the padding and border layers, the size of the box will always stay the same.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The CSS must include browser-specific prefixes:
            </p>
              <ul class="IndentedText">
                <li>-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                <li>-moz-box-sizing: border-box; </li>
                <li>-ms-box-sizing: border-box </li>
                <li>box-sizing: border-box</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              You can set the size of your box layers in pixels or in percentages:
            </p>
              <ul class="IndentedText">
                <li>
                	% changes the box as the screen size changes
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pixel sets the image to one size, regardless of device. This can lead to a bad user experience
                </li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              You can set max-width, so that an element can get smaller, but not larger than a set value.  Max-width won't change layout.

         			name = expression (where <em>name</em> is the <strong>identifier</strong> and <em>expression</em> is the <strong>value</strong>.)

         Values can be either text characters, referred to as "strings," or numbers, referred to either as "integers" (without decimal points) or as "floating" (with decimal points)

         In Python, any value/expression that is enclosed in quotation marks, whether single or double, will be interpreted as a string, as in the following examples:
        </p>
        	<ul class="NoBullets">
        		<li>
         			myName = "smebird" 
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			someNumbers = '0123456789' 
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			text_plusNumbers = '0123456789 and "smebird"' 
         		</li>
        	</ul>
    	</div>
    	<div class="TextFormat Text2">
        <p>
         To use Python to do any calculations, numbers are entered as a value with no quotation marks, as in the following examples:
        </p>
        	<ul class="NoBullets">
        		<li>
         			myAddition = 1 + 2 + 3000000000000 
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			myMultiplication = 1234 * 4321 
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			myExponents = 3**9 
         		</li>
        	</ul>
      </div>
    	<div class="TextFormat Text2">
        <p>
         	The convention for identifiers is to start with a lowercase character.  You cannot begin an identifier with a number.
        </p>
        <p>
         	Python will print strings in a different color, making it is easy to catch errors, like a forgotton end quote.
